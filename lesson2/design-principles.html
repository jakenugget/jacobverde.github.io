                <p>Rogue fitness has top of the line workout equipment mainly designed for professional athletes. They have a large selection of similar yet distinctly different equipment and example of this is barbells. In pictures they look identical except for color, but the differ in many ways. The bars need to be able to be used for different sports like Crossfit and Powerlifting and anything in between as well as use for different excerises in each sport.
                    <br><br>The drop down menus help to sift between adult, youth, female, and male bars. Some bars have higher tensile strength that the filter will help you find. Without the filtering system customers would have dificult time finding a bar that fits their needs. Ultimately leading to some customers not finding what they need and moving on.

                <p>I have spent a good amount of time on this website buying gifts for my wife and I have always noticed how bright and colorful it was. The design of this website creates contrast with the products on top of a white background. The menus all use bright and excited colors such as pink and orange which lead you to important parts of the page.
                    <br><br>Bright and colorful style is likely due to the customers they want to attract and the merchandise they sell. Cosmetics often come in bright vibrant colors and it just makes sense the website would match that.

                <p>If you follow sports more than likely you use ESPN to stay up to date. ESPN covers multiple sports and such they have created their website to show quick and easy ways to get to where you want to go. The menu uses easy to recognize logos to click on for each of the mains sports. This shows the most important links at the top very easy to click and see.
                    <br><br>After the main header they always show the most relevent sporting event happening right at this moment. In the picture you see the most recent NBA playoff game since this is the most relevant at this time. It then goes like a news feed as you scroll down to less and less recent events.
